CSS3
=====
Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is used for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers.

Advantages:
CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.

Pages load faster − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.

Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.

Superior styles to HTML − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.

Multiple Device Compatibility − Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.

Global web standards − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.

Css can be applied to web pages in 3ways
	1) Internal css
	2) External css
	3) Inline css


	syntax:
		selector{ 
		    property:value;		
			}
	ex:
		h1{
		color:red;
		}


css properties:
==========
color:red;
font-family:arial;
font-size:1.4em;
text-align:left/center/right;
background-color:yellow;
width:300px;
height:300px;
border:1px solid/dotted/dashed red;

2nd Aug:

border-left/right/top/bottom:10px solid red;
list-style-type:none/circle/square;
list-style-img:url(pic.jpg);

background-image:url(pic.jpg);
backgorund-repeat:no-repeat/repeat-x/repeat-y;

margin:30px; ===>margin is a space outside of the element
padding:30px; ===>padding is a space inside the element

Selectors:
==========
	1)Tag / Element Selector
		ex: h1{ }
	2) class selector
		ex: .abc{}
	3) id selector
		ex: #abc{}
	4) pseudo selector
		ex: a:hover{}

text-decoration:none;
3rd Aug:
=======
class selector:
=========
class selector is used to select all elements which belong to a particular class attribute. 
In order to select the elements with a particular class, use the period (.) character specifying the class name ie., it will match the HTML element based on the contents of their class attribute.

	.className{ }

	<h1 class="className"> </h1>

divisions:

float:left/right;

border-radius:30px;
border-radius:30px 0px;
border-radius:30px 0px 90px 10px;
border-radius:50%;
box-shadow:10px 10px 10px black;

Responsive Web Design(RWD)
=======================
Media queries:
------------------------
Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.


Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or other characteristics such as screen resolution or browser viewport width. 
Media queries are used for the following: 
To conditionally apply styles with the CSS @media and @import at-rules.

CSS Media queries are a way to target browser by certain characteristics, features, and user preferences, then apply styles or run other code based on those things. 

Perhaps the most common media queries in the world are those that target particular viewport ranges and apply custom styles, which birthed the whole idea of responsive design.

@media screen and (max-width:999px){

}

Id selector:
=========
 id's are used for unique elements. it should not be repeated. i.e it should not be called number of times, where as class can be called number of times

	#idName{ }

	<h2 id="idName"> </h2>

=======
transition:property time
transform:scale(1) / rotate() /skew()
cursor:pointer;

display:none/inline/block/inline-block/flex;

INLINE AND BLOCK ELEMENTS:
===========================
BLOCK ELEMENT:
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

INLINE ELEMENTS:
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
<img>
<a>

inline-block:
display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. Also, with display: inline-block , the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

FLEX BOX MODEL:
================
display:flex;
justify-content:flex-start / center /flex-end /space-around /space-between;   =>alinging horizontally
align-items:flex-start /center / flex-end;  ==>aligning vertically

Javascript
--------------
javascript is used for 'Client side' applications
using javascript 
	interactive website, 
	dynamic websites and 
	client side validations can be done

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.


computers can understand only machine language, it will not understand english, telugu or any other language
	i.e => binary code ==> 0 or 1
	for example
		a=>01100110
Converting user language to machine language is possible with compiler or interpreter

Compiling vs Interpreted Language:
===========================
What is Compiled Language?
A compiled language is a programming language that is generally compiled and not interpreted. It is one where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine; this machine code is undecipherable by humans. Types of compiled language – C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc. 

What is Interpreted Language?
An interpreted language is a programming language that is generally interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions. 
It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead, read and executed by some other program. Interpreted language ranges – JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc. 

javascript comes under interpreted language

	SOURCE CODE   ==>INTERPRETER ==>OUTPUT

Variables:
========
=>variables are contianers which are used to store the data
=>Variable a symbolic name associated with a value and whose associated value may be changed.
=>Variables are Containers for Storing Data
	
=>variables can be declared in javascript in 3 ways:
	1) var keyword   	=> var fname
	2) let keyword	=> let fname	
	3) const keyword	=> const fname

	let and const keywords are introduced in ES6(Ecma Script)

	
		var fname  		=>declaring a variable 
		fname="Javascript"   	=>assigning a value to a variable

DOM:
What is a DOM in JavaScript?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.


document.getElementById():
The getElementById() method is one of the most common methods in the HTML DOM. 
It is used almost every time you want to read or edit an HTML element.

length property:
============
	used to findout lenght of a given string


Arrays:
=====
Arrays are also variables with multiple data values
Arrays enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name
=>JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types.
=>JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on

var students=["Anil", "Chetan", "Bharat", "Deepak"]

Objects:
=======
JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods.

An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. 

A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life.

ex:
	let car={
		//property:value
		color:'red',
		company:'Hyundai',
		mfg:2023
	}

	console.log(car.color)


11th Sept:
=======
Loops
Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object

do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

for loop:
======
syntax:
	for(initialise, condition, increment / decrement){
		code....
	}

<select>
<option>1</option>
<option>2</option>
<option>3</option>
<option>4</option>
</select>


while loop

Functions:
=======
A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. 
Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. 

Functions are 2 types
	1) inbuilt function	
		ex:Date() 
	2) User definef function
		ex: sudhakar()

How to define a function:
===================
1)	Normal function:(since begining of js)

	function Sudhakar(){
		code...
	}

	Sudhakar()


2)	Arrow function:(introduced in ES6(2015))

	const Sudhakar=()=>{
		code...
	}

	Sudhakar()

3) 	Anonymouse function:function without any name
	
	const Sudhakar=function(){
		code...
	}



Functions with Parameters and Arguments:
===============================
A parameter is one of the variables in a function. 
When the function is called,the arguments are the data you pass into the function's parameters.

	function Demo(uid){

	}

	Demo('javascript')
	Demo('React')


return statement:
==============
The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value.
	function Demo(){
		return "Hello js"
	}
	Demo()


Events:
=====

        place:'Hyderabad',
        age:22
    }

    for(x in obj){
        //console.log(x)
        //document.write(x)
        //console.log(`key is :${x} and value is ${obj[x]}`)
        document.write(`key is :${x} and value is ${obj[x]}`)
    }

------------
for of:

    const arr=['a','b','c','d']

    for(x of arr){
        console.log(x)
        document.write(x+"<br>")
    }

    alert(bmi)
---------------------------------

17th Sept:
============

forEach():
=======
The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.

The forEach() method is not executed for empty elements.

const fruits = ["apple", "orange", "cherry"];
fruits.forEach(test)

function test(item){
document.write("<li>"+item+"</li>")
}
-----------------

Nested for loops:
============
What is a nested for loop in JavaScript?
We use the for loop statement of JavaScript for repeating a set of statements inside the loop body a specified number of times. A nested for loop, as the name suggests, is made up of more than one for loop one nested inside of the other. This allows us to loop over multidimensional data structures such as matrices.

How does a nested for loop work in JavaScript?
The most common type of nested loops will be one loop inside another. 
The first loop is usually called the outer loop while the second loop is called the inner loop. 
The outer loop always executes first, and the inner loop executes inside the outer loop each time the outer loop executes once.


for(){		==>outer for loop
	for(){	==>inner for loop

	}
}

-------------------------------
onkeydown and onkeyup event
onscroll event
onload event

	ex:6
Math.ceil(6.4)  => upto nearest
	ex:7
Math.random() =>Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.
Math.max() =>Returns the largest of zero or more numbers.
Math.min() =>Returns the smallest of zero or more numbers.
Math.trunc(6.7)=> returns the integer part of x:
	ex:6
Math.sign(-6)=> Returns the sign of the x, indicating whether x is positive, negative, or zero.
	ex:-1
Math.sqrt(100) =>Returns the positive square root of x.
	ex: 10
Math.abs(x)=>returns the absolute (positive) value of x:
	ex:-6.7 => 6.7

Regular Expressions:
=================

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. 
In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. 

   var str="javaScript";
   var pat=/[A-Z]/g;
   var res=str.match(pat);
   document.write(res);

[A-Z]
[a-z]
[0-9]
[^A-Z]  =>not A-Z
[^a-z]
[^0-9]

{3}==>3 letters
{3,6} ==>3-6

Search:
======
str.search("web");

Replace:
=======
str.replace("html","javascript");

Destructuring:
=============
What is the Destructuring in JavaScript?
Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. That is, we can extract data from arrays and objects and assign them to variables.

        // let user=['Anil','Hyderabad',22]
            // //let name=user[0]=>old method
        // let [name,place,age]=user
        // console.log(name)
        // console.log(place)
        // console.log(age)


Exception handling:
===================
What is exception handling in JavaScript?
Exception Handling Statements. An exception is an abnormal or unexpected condition that occurs during the runtime, and javascript provides various statements or a combination of statements to handle the exceptions. It handles exceptions in try-catch-finally statements and throws statements.


try and catch:

try{
var a= ["34","32","5","31","24","44","67"]; 
document.write(a);    
document.write(b);  
}catch(e){
alert("There is error which shows "+e.message); //Handling error
}

22nd Sept:
==========
const num1=Math.ceil(Math.random()*10)
console.log(num1)

const num1=Math.ceil(Math.random()*10)
const num2=Math.ceil(Math.random()*10)
const total=num1*num2
console.log(num1+" "+num2+"= "+total)
----------------------------------------------
  var x = document.getElementById("myInput");
  if (x.type == "password") {
    x.type = "text";
  } else {
    x.type = "password";
  }
--------------------------------------------------
getElementById
getElementByTagName
getElementByClassName

querySelector()  ==.it is alternativ to above 3 methods
=>document.querySelector("#box")
---------------------------------------------------
addEventListerner():

What is a addEventListener in JavaScript?
The addEventListener() is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired. Any number of event handlers can be added to a single element without overwriting existing event handlers.

document.addEventListener("click", function(){
//alert("hello");
document.body.style.background="yellow";
});

----------------------------------------
localStorage:

localStorage.setItem("name","Sudhakar")
localStorage.setItem("email","ss@gmail.com")
document.write(localStorage.getItem('name'));
//localStorage.removeItem('email')
//localStorage.clear()

25th Sept;
=======
createElement() ==>h1,p, li,etc
createTextNode()
appendChild()
innerText()

getElementsByTagName()
getElementsByClassName()
querySelector()
querySelectorAll()

-----------------------
Spread Operator:
============
The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object. 

	const arr1=['a','b','c']
	const arr2=['d','e','f']
	const comb=[...arr1, ...arr2]

Ternary operator:
==============
The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: 
	=>a condition followed by a question mark (?), 
	=>then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), 
	=>and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. 
This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

	var x="javascript"
	b=(x=="javascript" ? "You are right":"You are wrong")


Template Literals:
=============
Template literals are alternative to concatination with variables
	var x="javascript"
	document.write("Hello "+x)

alternative to above code is Template literals
in Template literals we use ' Back Tick (`) '
	var x="javascript"
	document.write(` Hello ${x}`)
